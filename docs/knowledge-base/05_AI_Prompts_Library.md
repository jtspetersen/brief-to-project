## Tips for Effective AI Prompting

### Best Practices
1. **Be Specific**: Provide detailed context rather than general questions
2. **Structure Input**: Use bullet points, headings, and clear formatting
3. **Define Success**: Tell the AI what a good response looks like
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on initial responses
5. **Validate**: Always verify AI output against your knowledge and data

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Vague or overly broad questions
- ❌ Assuming AI has context it doesn't have
- ❌ Not specifying format or structure desired
- ❌ Taking AI output as final without validation
- ❌ Using AI for decisions only humans should make

### Customization Tips
- Add your organization's specific terminology
- Include relevant constraints from your environment
- Reference your company's methodologies or frameworks
- Adjust output format to match your templates
- Add examples of good outputs when training prompts
