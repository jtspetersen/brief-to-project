## Managing Difficult Stakeholders

### Common Challenges and Strategies

**The Blocker**
- **Behavior**: Actively opposes program, withholds resources or approval
- **Root Cause**: Usually fear of loss (control, resources, relevance)
- **Strategy**:
  1. Understand their specific concerns through private conversation
  2. Identify areas where you can accommodate without compromising program
  3. Show how program benefits them or their interests
  4. If unresolved, escalate to sponsor with proposed solutions

**The Absentee**
- **Behavior**: Doesn't engage, misses meetings, doesn't respond
- **Root Cause**: Competing priorities, doesn't see relevance, or passive resistance
- **Strategy**:
  1. Make it easy to engage (flexible meeting times, concise updates)
  2. Clarify what specifically you need from them and why
  3. Escalate if their input is critical and they remain unresponsive
  4. Document attempts to engage for accountability

**The Micromanager**
- **Behavior**: Wants excessive detail, frequent updates, control over decisions
- **Root Cause**: Anxiety, lack of trust, or need for control
- **Strategy**:
  1. Provide extra transparency through dashboards or detailed reports
  2. Establish structured touchpoints to reduce ad-hoc requests
  3. Build trust by consistently delivering and being proactive with information
  4. Set boundaries on decision-making authority clearly

**The Constant Changer**
- **Behavior**: Frequently changes requirements or priorities
- **Root Cause**: Unclear vision, responding to external pressures, or indecisiveness
- **Strategy**:
  1. Implement formal change control process
  2. Show impact of each change on timeline, budget, scope
  3. Help them prioritize by forcing tradeoff discussions
  4. Get changes approved by governance body, not just individual

## Stakeholder Relationship Health Monitoring

### Relationship Scorecard

Rate each key stakeholder relationship on a 1-5 scale:

| [Name] | 2 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 2.5 | → | Schedule alignment meeting |
| [Name] | 3 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 3.0 | ↓ | Increase communication |

**Rating Scale:**
- **5**: Excellent - actively championing program
- **4**: Good - supportive with minor concerns
- **3**: Fair - neutral or mixed
- **2**: Poor - significant concerns or disengagement
- **1**: Critical - blocking or actively opposing

### Warning Signs

Watch for these indicators of stakeholder relationship problems:
